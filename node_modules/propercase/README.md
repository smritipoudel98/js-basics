This simple module can be used to proper case (sometimes called title case) a string.

It works by lower-casing the string and then capitalizing the first character after certain special characters.

Right now these special characters are defined by: var characters = [' ', '-', '\'', '.'];

## Installation

```
npm install propercase --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
var pcase = require('propercase');

console.log(pcase("whaaat? my first public m'odule"));
```

## Examples:

```
"jim test" becomes "Jim Test"

"JIM TEST" becomes "Jim Test"

"conan o'brien" becomes "Conan O'Brien"

"CONAN O'BRIEN" becomes "Conan O'Brien"

"This-Is A Mix'Of'Tests For Mr.Smith And Mr.Jones" becomes "This-Is A Mix'Of'Tests For Mr.Smith And Mr.Jones"
```
